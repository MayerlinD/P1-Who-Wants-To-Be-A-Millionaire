                        the ultimate quiz competition! Your goal is to correctly answer a series of 15 questions. Sounds easy enough, right? <br>
                        <br> Not quite. With every question, the level of difficulty will increase and you will be racing against the clock to answer each question. Each question is worth a specific amount of money; the amounts are not cumulative. If at any time you answer incorrectly, the game is over and your winnings are reduced to $0 for tier-one questions, $1,000 for tier-two questions, and $32,000 for tier-three questions.<br>
                        <br> Ready to play for your chance at $1,000,000? <br><br>
